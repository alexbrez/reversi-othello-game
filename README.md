♟️ Reversi with AI
A Python implementation of the classic Reversi (Othello) board game. This game features:

 - A user-friendly interface for player moves.
 - A basic AI opponent powered by the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for competitive gameplay.
   
📖 About the Project
Reversi is a two-player strategy board game. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board, flipping their opponent's pieces, and aiming to have the most pieces of their color by the end of the game. This implementation provides:

 - A human-vs-computer experience.
 - An AI opponent that calculates optimal moves using Minimax.
 - An 8x8 board setup initialized with standard Reversi rules.
 - 
🛠️ Features
 - Interactive Gameplay: Players input their moves via the terminal.
 - AI Opponent: The computer uses Minimax with a depth of 3 for decision-making.
 - Game Logic: Includes move validation, piece flipping, and endgame conditions.
 - Dynamic Board Display: The board updates after every move, showing the current game state.

🖥️ How to Play
1.Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/your-username/reversi-ai.git
   - cd reversi-ai
  
2.Run the game: Ensure you have Python installed, then execute:
   - python reversi.py
  
Gameplay Instructions:

 - The player (X) goes first.
 - Input your move by providing the row and column indices (0-7).
 - The computer (O) will calculate its move automatically.
 - The game ends when no valid moves are available for both players.

🧠 AI Implementation
The AI opponent uses the Minimax Algorithm with the following features:

 - Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes the search process by pruning unneeded branches.
 - Evaluation Function: Counts the difference between X and O pieces on the board.
   
📄 Rules of Reversi
 - Players take turns placing their pieces on the board.
 - A valid move must outflank one or more of the opponent's pieces in a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
 - All outflanked pieces are flipped to the current player's color.
 - The game ends when neither player has a valid move.
 - The winner is the player with the most pieces of their color on the board.

🔧 Future Enhancements
 - Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
 - Allow players to adjust AI difficulty (change Minimax depth).
 - Implement multiplayer functionality.

Enjoy strategizing with Reversi! 🎮♟️
